            <p>We are practically never alone. We are social creatures, and we share our experiences. But what if you are no longer 
            here? Would you not like your loved ones to know what you would have wanted? My Message From Beyond is a tool created to 
            help your loved ones! A small amount of invested time right now could help your loved ones cope after your death.</p>

            <p>After you register, you can enter your wishes immediately. Do your loved ones know what you want? Do not leave them 
            with questions, instead tell them exactly how you would have wanted it. It is definitely not always easy to think about, 
            but it will ease the process for those you love. Things to consider include music, floral arrangements, etc. You can be as 
             specific as you like. Can you afford a notary to continually update your official documents? If you document exactly what
              it is you want right now, and update as it is necessary, your loved ones will not have to guess as circumstances change 
              throughout your life. Updating your wishes is very quick and simple.What you document on My Message From Beyond will not 
              supersede any official documents (i.e. will or testament), but it does serve as guidelines for your loved ones.</p>

             contact information and is free of charge.What does it mean to be a confidant?Being a confidant is a great honor but 
             also a great responsibility. It means you are the person who has to make the declaration or confirm when this user has 
             passed away and get all the information that is left behind.There is a minimum of 3 trustees as this is the minimum 
             required to make the declaration</p>
